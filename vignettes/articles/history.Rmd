## McKhann et al. (1984): The clinical turn

In a landmark consensus paper, @McKhann.N.1984 established the first widely
adopted clinical diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) under the
joint auspices of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative
Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS)^[Now called [National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/)] and the Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA)^[Now called [Alzheimer's
Association (AA)](https://www.alz.org/)].

Briefly, these criteria introduced a three-tier classification system,
reflecting increasing levels of diagnostic certainty:

- **Possible AD**: cases with atypical features or the presence of comorbid
conditions that could contribute to dementia, but where Alzheimer's disease
remains a likely diagnosis;

- **Probable AD**: a clinical diagnosis based on insidious onset and progressive
memory and cognitive decline, in the absence of alternative explanations^[Among
the disorders that must be excluded are manic-depressive disorder, Parkinson's,
disease, multi-infarct dementia, and drug intoxication; less commonly
encountered disorders that may cause dementia include thyroid disease,
pernicious anemia, luetic brain disease and other chronic infections of the
nervous system, subdural hematoma, occult hydrocephalus, Huntington’s disease,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and brain tumors.];

- **Definite AD**: requires all the criteria for **Probable AD**, combined with
histopathological confirmation of Alzheimer’s-specific brain lesions at
autopsy or biopsy.

Although grounded in clinical observation, the framework acknowledged the
absence of specific biomarkers and the high misclassification rate^[20% or more
of cases with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease are found at autopsy
to have other conditions and not Alzheimer’s disease.] in clinical practice.

## Blacker et al. (1994): Toward refining diagnostic accuracy

@Blacker.AoN.1994 conducted a multisite study to evaluate the reliability
and validity of the NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease
(AD), originally proposed in [@McKhann.N.1984]. Using autopsy-confirmed
diagnoses as the gold standard, the study assessed how well clinicians across
three academic centers could classify 60 cases (AD and non-AD) based on detailed
clinical summaries.

The findings supported moderate inter-rater reliability and good post-consensus
validity of the criteria, but also revealed important diagnostic
limitations—especially in atypical presentations.

Key recommendations for refining the criteria:

1. Early behavioral symptoms (e.g. personality change, disinhibition) were often
associated with non-AD pathologies, such as Pick's disease or hippocampal
sclerosis. The authors suggested that such cases should not be classified as
probable or possible AD under future criteria.

2. Prominent early language dysfunction (e.g. progressive aphasia) also
frequently corresponded to non-AD pathology. The authors proposed these cases
be diagnosed as possible AD only, and only when otherwise typical.

3. The distinction between probable and possible AD showed little difference in
predictive value, questioning the usefulness of treating them as hierarchically
distinct in terms of diagnostic certainty.

4. The study highlighted the need for greater clarity in temporal relationships
between cognitive decline and co-occurring neurological or psychiatric symptoms,
as this was a common source of diagnostic error.

5 The authors advocated for future formal revisions of the criteria to
incorporate these observations—many of which were already reflected in the
clinical judgment of experienced diagnosticians.

This work laid the groundwork for future revisions of AD diagnostic frameworks,
including the NIA-AA criteria and the AT(N) biomarker model, by underscoring the
limits of symptom-based classification and the need to refine criteria for
atypical and mixed presentations.
