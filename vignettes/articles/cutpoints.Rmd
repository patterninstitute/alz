Biomarker cut-points are key parameters that provide a simple and pragmatic
approach to translating raw biomarker measurements into positivity results
that are, expectedly, associated with biological or clinical significance.

Typically, biomarker measurements will be associated with biological or clinical
significance in a monotonically pattern, either increasing or decreasingly, e.g.
increasing levels of total-tau protein can be indicative of tau proteinopathy,
whereas Aβ proteinopathy is indicated by decreasing levels of Aβ42.
