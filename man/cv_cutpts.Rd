\title{Adjust cut-points using assay precision}
\usage{
cv_cutpts(cutpts, cv, dist = c("lognormal", "normal"), level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{cutpts}{A numeric vector of length 1 or 2, representing cut-point(s).}

\item{cv}{A positive scalar: coefficient of variation to apply.}

\item{dist}{A character scalar, either \code{"normal"} or \code{"lognormal"}, indicating
the distributional assumption used when applying the CV.}

\item{level}{Confidence level to use (default = 0.95).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 2: \code{c(lower, upper)}.
}
\description{
Adjusts one or two diagnostic cut-points using a coefficient of variation
(CV) to account for measurement uncertainty. When a single cut-point is
provided, it is expanded into a confidence interval based on the expected
assay precision. When two cut-points are given (e.g. for defining an
indeterminate or equivocal zone), each is adjusted independently: the lower
cut-point defines the lower bound, and the upper cut-point defines the upper
bound of the resulting interval. This is useful when applying classification
rules to continuous biomarker values under analytical variability.
