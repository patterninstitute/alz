\usage{
biomarkers()
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{bmk_id}}{Short identifier for the biomarker (e.g., \code{"ab42"}, \code{"ptau181_ab42_ratio"}).}
\item{\code{bmk_name}}{Human-readable label (e.g., \code{"Aβ42 / Aβ40"}, \code{"Amyloid PET"}).}
\item{\code{bmk_category}}{Top-level role: \code{"core"}, \code{"non-specific"}, or \code{"co-pathology"}.}
\item{\code{bmk_class}}{Stage or use-tier within category (e.g., \code{"core 1"}, \code{"core 2"}).}
\item{\code{bmk_subclass}}{Biological process aligned with the ATNISV framework (e.g., \code{"A"}, \code{"T1"}, \code{"N"}).}
\item{\code{bmk_modality}}{Measurement domain: \code{"fluid"} or \code{"imaging"}.}
\item{\code{bmk_type}}{Whether the biomarker is \code{"original"} (directly measured) or \code{"derived"} (e.g., ratios).}
\item{\code{analyte_ids}}{List of one or more analyte IDs underpinning the biomarker definition.}
\item{\code{bmk_desc}}{Short description of what the biomarker measures or represents.}
}

\description{
\code{\link[=biomarkers]{biomarkers()}} a dataset of curated biomarkers relevant to Alzheimer's
disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative conditions. Each row corresponds
to a defined biomarker, including both directly measured biomarkers and
derived indicators such as ratios. Variables include identification of the
biomarker (\code{bmk_id} and \code{bmk_name}), reference(s) to underpinning analyte(s)
(\code{analyte_ids}), and classification details.
}
\details{
Biomarkers are organized into a structured, three-tier classification system
that reflects their biological role, pathogenic target, and stage in the
disease process:
\itemize{
\item \code{bmk_category}: the highest level of classification, reflecting the
biomarker's overall diagnostic role. Categories include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"core"}: biomarkers of AD neuropathologic change (ADNPC), essential for
diagnosis and staging;
\item \code{"non-specific"}: biomarkers relevant to AD pathophysiology but not
specific to AD;
\item \code{"co-pathology"}: markers that capture common comorbid pathologies
frequently co-occurring with AD.
}
\item \code{bmk_class}: a subdivision of the category level, used to distinguish
between earlier- and later-appearing markers in the course of disease
progression.

For example:
\itemize{
\item \code{"core 1"} includes A and T1 markers that become abnormal early and
support diagnosis;
\item \code{"core 2"} includes T2 markers that become abnormal later and support
disease staging.
}
\item \code{bmk_subclass}: identifies the specific biological process or proteinopathy
the biomarker represents, aligned with the updated ATNISV framework:
\itemize{
\item \code{"A"}: amyloid-beta proteinopathy;
\item \code{"T1"}: soluble tau fragments (e.g., p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231);
\item \code{"T2"}: tau aggregates (e.g., tau PET, MTBR-tau243);
\item \code{"N"}: neurodegeneration;
\item \code{"I"}: inflammation and immune activation;
\item \code{"S"}: synucleinopathy;
\item \code{"V"}: vascular brain injury.
}
}

In contrast, the \code{bmk_modality} field is not part of the classification
hierarchy but denotes the technical measurement domain—either \code{"fluid"}
(e.g., CSF, plasma) or \code{"imaging"} (e.g., PET, MRI). This
distinction is critical because the same biological process (e.g., amyloid
pathology) may be captured through multiple modalities, which differ in their
temporal resolution, biological specificity, and clinical application. The
updated criteria explicitly reject the assumption of equivalence between
fluid and imaging biomarkers, hence the need to treat modality separately.
