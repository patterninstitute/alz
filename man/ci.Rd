\title{Confidence interval from coefficient of variation}
\usage{
ci(x, cv, dist = c("lognormal", "normal"), level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of positive measured values.}

\item{cv}{A positive scalar: coefficient of variation (e.g., 0.10 for 10\%).}

\item{dist}{A character scalar indicating the distributional assumption used to
compute the confidence interval. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"normal"}: assumes measurement errors are normally distributed. The confidence
interval will be symmetric around the observed value.
\item \code{"lognormal"}: assumes measurement errors follow a log-normal distribution.
This results in an asymmetric confidence interval, which is often more appropriate
for strictly positive and right-skewed measurements (e.g., biomarker concentrations).
}}

\item{level}{Confidence level as a proportion (e.g., 0.95 for 95\%). Default is 0.95.}
}
\value{
A matrix with two columns (\code{lower}, \code{upper}) and one row per element
of \code{x}.
}
\description{
\code{\link[=ci]{ci()}} calculates the confidence interval around observed values given a
coefficient of variation (CV).

\examples{
# Lognormal assumption is often more appropriate for strictly positive
# and right-skewed measurements (e.g., biomarker concentrations).
ci(c(100, 200), 0.10, dist = "lognormal", level = 0.95)

# Normal assumption
ci(c(100, 200), 0.10, dist = "normal", level = 0.95)
