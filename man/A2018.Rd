\title{Combine A biomarkers under the 2018 scheme}
\usage{
A2018(ab40, ab42, ab42_ab40_ratio, amyloid_pet)
}
\arguments{
\item{ab40}{AB40 as a \code{bmk} vector (no default; can omit)}

\item{ab42}{AB42 as a \code{bmk} vector (no default; can omit)}

\item{ab42_ab40_ratio}{AB42/AB40 ratio as a \code{bmk} vector (no default; can omit)}

\item{amyloid_pet}{Amyloid PET as a \code{bmk} vector (no default; can omit)}
}
\value{
A \code{bmk} vector representing the combined A-status --- one biomarker
positive is sufficient to render A-status positive.
}
\description{
Computes the overall A-status by OR-combining any subset of these biomarkers:
\itemize{
\item ab40
\item ab42
\item ab42_ab40_ratio
\item amyloid_pet
At least one of these must be supplied. Missing (zero-length) inputs are
treated as \code{NA} to allow proper Kleene OR logic.
